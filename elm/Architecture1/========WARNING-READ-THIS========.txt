Two of these applications have a mild strobing effect:

* Random1.elm
* TypeChangeSolution.elm

They display numbers that change very quickly.

A third, ColorWheelSolution.elm, has a much stronger strobing
effect. The numbers not only change, but the font size and color
change. You can reduce the effect by removing either or both of these
tuples in `Style.elm`

  style [ ("color", colorWheelString iteration)
        , ("font-size", fontSizeString iteration)
        ]

If you remove both, the strobing effect will be the same as for `Random1.elm`.
